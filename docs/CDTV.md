# Amiga Commodore CDTV

This is essentially an Amiga 500 except :
- It has a CD-ROM, also exposed as "cdtv.service" for operations like CDDA.
- 1MB of Chip RAM.
- Kickstart 1.3 (later revisions came with Expanded ROMs of 2.3+)

Unlike the CD32, it requires its own CDTV.TM file as a certain offset.
Although it seems the tool for it make_cd32, doesn't work properly for CDTV.
