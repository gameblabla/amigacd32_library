# TODO list

- Implement faster functions, particulary for OCS/ECS
Blitter functions are infamous for being awful on Kickstart 1.3.

Hoping to use this as a reference but he did not implement
both bobs and tilemap at the same time :

- HAM6/HAM8 modes
So far, only supported by the semi broken CDXL player.

- Improve CDXL player or converter
It kind of sucks rn... Hoping to find a better solution.

- Bypass the OS eventually.

For CDDA (CDTV) :

CD32, i'm not sure.
Loading files off the CD : No idea either.

If we can at least do it for CDDA, then we can eventually use Forbid/Permit.
